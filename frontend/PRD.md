- **Mood/Energy Check: Before starting, users select how they’re feeling using simple mood cards (“Foggy”, “Okay”, “Motivated”, etc.), with an option to skip if wanted. The app adapts the length and complexity of the session to their current state.
- **Quick Access:** One-click entry to daily activities
- **Activity Selection:** AI-recommended or user-chosen exercises
- **Progress Feedback:** Immediate performance feedback and celebratory note
- **Session Completion:** Summary of achievements and next steps. Options to continue working on more or to return tomorrow

- **Activities must include visuals and drag and drop features wherever applicable
- **Curated Activities: Based on their goals (rehabilitation, prevention, or both) and today’s mood, users are presented with a tailored set of exercises that can be completed in less than 10 minutes each. 3 exercises by default and up to 5 for rehab. for the following areas: attention, perception, memory, language, executive function, spatial reasoning, processing speed and creativity. 
- **Real-World, Gentle Tasks: Each activity is short and goal-oriented and relevant to real life

- **Adaptivity: Sessions flex to user needs each day, recognizing the highs and lows common in both trauma recovery and general aging.

Example Day-in-the-Life:
•	Jane, recovering from TBI, logs in, picks “Foggy” on her mood card.
•	Today’s session is short: a word-completion task, a gentle sequencing game (“Arrange your lunch steps”), and three rounds of practicing greetings.
•	After gentle feedback and encouragement—plus a break mid-session—Jane ends her session; her caregiver can view her steady progress and leave her a cheerful note.
•	The next day, feeling better, Jane chooses “Motivated”—and the app serves up more challenging exercises, possibly with a buddy.
