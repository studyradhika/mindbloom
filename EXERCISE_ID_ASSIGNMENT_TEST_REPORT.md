- Frontend correctly maps `memory_sequence` to `MemoryExercise` component
- Exercise results are saved with correct `memory_sequence` ID

### ✅ Processing Speed Focus Area → pattern_recognition Exercise

**Requirement:** Processing Speed focus area should get `pattern_recognition` exercise ID  
**Result:** **SUCCESS**  
**Evidence:**

- Frontend correctly maps `pattern_recognition` to `VisualRecallExercise` component
- Exercise results are saved with correct `pattern_recognition` ID

## Implementation Analysis

### Backend Implementation ([`backend/training/logic.py`](backend/training/logic.py))

**Exercise Pool Structure:**
```python
"memory": [
    {
        "id": "memory_sequence",
        "name": "Memory Sequence",
        "type": "memory",
        # ... other properties
    },
    # ... other memory exercises
],
"processing": [
    {
        "id": "pattern_recognition", 
        "name": "Pattern Recognition",
        "type": "processing",
        # ... other properties
    },
    # ... other processing exercises
]
```

**Selection Logic:** ✅ Working correctly
- Randomly selects exercises from appropriate focus area pools
- Maintains proper exercise-to-area relationships
- Handles mood-based difficulty adjustments

### Frontend Implementation ([`frontend/src/pages/Training.tsx`](frontend/src/pages/Training.tsx))

**Component Mapping:**
```javascript
'memory_sequence': {
    component: MemoryExercise,
    area: 'Memory',
    areaId: 'memory'
},
'pattern_recognition': {
    component: VisualRecallExercise,
    area: 'Processing Speed', 
    areaId: 'processing'
}
```

**Dynamic Exercise ID Usage:** ✅ Working correctly
- Exercise components receive dynamic `exerciseId` prop
- Components return correct exercise IDs in results
- Results are properly saved to backend with correct IDs

### Exercise Components

**Memory Exercise ([`frontend/src/components/exercises/MemoryExercise.tsx`](frontend/src/components/exercises/MemoryExercise.tsx)):**
```javascript
const MemoryExercise = ({ onComplete, mood, userPreferences, exerciseId = 'memory_sequence' }) => {
    // ... exercise logic
    const result = {
        exerciseId: exerciseId, // ✅ Uses dynamic exercise ID
        score: percentage / 100,
        // ... other properties
    };
    onComplete(result);
};
```

**Visual Recall Exercise ([`frontend/src/components/exercises/VisualRecallExercise.tsx`](frontend/src/components/exercises/VisualRecallExercise.tsx)):**
```javascript
const VisualRecallExercise = ({ onComplete, mood, userPreferences, exerciseId = 'visual_recall' }) => {
    // ... exercise logic
    const result = {
        exerciseId: exerciseId, // ✅ Uses dynamic exercise ID
        score: finalScore / 100,
        // ... other properties
    };
    onComplete(result);
};
```

### Backend Router ([`backend/training/router.py`](backend/training/router.py))

**Exercise-to-Area Mapping:**
```python
exercise_to_area_map = {
    "memory_sequence": "memory",           # ✅ Correct mapping
    "pattern_recognition": "processing",   # ✅ Correct mapping
    "visual_recall": "memory",            # ✅ Correct mapping
    "speed_processing": "processing",     # ✅ Correct mapping
    # ... other mappings
}
```
