# 1) Executive Summary
This document outlines the backend development plan for the MindBloom application, a cognitive wellness platform. The backend will be built using FastAPI and MongoDB Atlas, adhering to the constraints of no Docker, frontend-driven manual testing, and a `main`-only Git workflow. The plan is structured into a dynamic number of sprints to cover all features observed in the existing frontend, ensuring a scalable and maintainable architecture.

# 2) In-scope & Success Criteria
- **In-scope:**
  - User registration and authentication (signup, login, logout).
  - Storage and retrieval of user profile data, including preferences and cognitive conditions.
  - Adaptive exercise session management based on user's mood and focus areas.
  - Tracking and storage of user progress, including session history, streaks, and performance metrics.
  - API endpoints to support the dashboard, training, and progress pages.
- **Success criteria:**
  - All frontend features are fully supported by the backend.
  - Each sprint's deliverables pass manual testing via the UI.
  - The backend is successfully deployed and connected to the frontend.
  - Code is committed and pushed to the `main` branch after each successful sprint.

# 3) API Design
- **Conventions:**
  - Base path: `/api/v1`
  - Errors will return a consistent JSON object: `{"detail": "Error message"}`.
- **Endpoints:**
  - **Auth**
    - `POST /api/v1/auth/signup`: Register a new user.
      - Request: `{ "name": "string", "email": "string", "password": "string", "ageGroup": "string", "cognitiveConditions": ["string"], "otherCondition": "string", "reminderTime": "string" }`
      - Response: `{ "access_token": "string", "token_type": "bearer" }`
    - `POST /api/v1/auth/login`: Authenticate a user.
      - Request: `{ "username": "string", "password": "string" }` (Note: username is the email)
      - Response: `{ "access_token": "string", "token_type": "bearer" }`
    - `GET /api/v1/auth/me`: Get the current user's data.
      - Response: User object.
  - **Users**
    - `GET /api/v1/users/me`: Get the current user's profile.
      - Response: User object.
  - **Training**

      - Request: `{ "mood": "string", "focusAreas": ["string"] }`
      - Response: `{ "sessionId": "string", "exercises": ["object"] }`
    - `POST /api/v1/training/session/{sessionId}/complete`: Complete a training session.
      - Request: `{ "results": ["object"] }`
      - Response: `{ "message": "Session completed successfully" }`
  - **Progress**
    - `GET /api/v1/progress`: Get the user's progress data.
      - Response: `{ "summary": "object", "history": ["object"] }`

# 5) Frontend Audit & Feature Map
- **Routes/Components:**
  - `Registration.tsx`: User creation.
    - Backend: `POST /api/v1/auth/signup`, `users` model.
  - `SignIn.tsx`: User login.
    - Backend: `POST /api/v1/auth/login`.
  - `Dashboard.tsx`: Main user dashboard.
    - Backend: `GET /api/v1/users/me`, `training_sessions` model.
  - `Training.tsx`: Active exercise session.
    - Backend: `POST /api/v1/training/session`, `POST /api/v1/training/session/{sessionId}/complete`.
  - `Progress.tsx`: User progress and analytics.
    - Backend: `GET /api/v1/progress`, `training_sessions` model.
- **Forms:**
  - Registration form: Collects name, email, age group, cognitive conditions.
  - Login form: Collects email and password.
- **Async Needs:**
  - All interactions with the backend are async (fetching user data, starting/completing sessions).

# 6) Configuration & ENV Vars (core only)
- `APP_ENV`: "development"
- `PORT`: 8000
- `MONGODB_URI`: (user provided)
- `JWT_SECRET`: (randomly generated string)
- `JWT_EXPIRES_IN`: 3600
- `CORS_ORIGINS`: "http://localhost:5173" (or frontend URL)

# 9) Testing Strategy (Manual via Frontend)
- **Policy:** All backend features will be validated by interacting with the connected frontend. Network tab in browser DevTools will be used to inspect API requests and responses.
- **Per-sprint Manual Test Checklist (Frontend):** Each sprint will include a specific checklist of UI actions to perform.
- **User Test Prompt:** Each sprint will include a short, clear prompt for a non-technical user to test the implemented features.
- **Post-sprint:** If all tests pass, changes will be committed and pushed to the `main` branch on GitHub.
